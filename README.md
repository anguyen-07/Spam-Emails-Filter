# Spam-Emails-Filter

Most spam messages can usually be identified in a personâ€™s email list through the subject line and sender, but may occassionally require a glimpse of the message contents to provide a more conclusive approach. Spam filters examine these various characteristics of an email before classifying the message and placing it into the inbox of a spam folder.

In this analysis, a classification tree-based model will be built to predict whether an email message is spam (unwanted) or not spam (wanted) through recursive partitioning.
